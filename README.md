Veritas Analytics - Minimalist Storytelling Sales Deck

This repository contains a high-fidelity, interactive proof-of-concept sales deck created specifically to meet the design criteria of the Upwork brief: Minimalist Design and Harvard Style Storytelling.

This artifact showcases the "deliver first" philosophy by providing a polished, ready-to-view presentation.

Methodology: Harvard Storytelling Arc

The presentation is structured around a classic, persuasive narrative framework to ensure maximum resonance with executive stakeholders:

The Hook (Slide 1): Start with an unexpected and compelling Problem (85% of data is wasted) to immediately capture attention.

The Conflict (Slide 2): Validate the client's current painâ€”Friction in the status quo (Analysis Paralysis).

The Climax (Slide 3): Introduce the brand (Veritas Analytics) as the elegant Solution that cuts through complexity to deliver a clear SIGNAL.

The Resolution (Slide 4): Show the transformative Future State (Insight, Confidence, Growth) and provide a clear Call to Action (CTA).

Aesthetic: Minimalist & Professional

Color Palette: Strict two-tone approach using Deep Charcoal (#1A202C) and a professional Dark Blue accent (#10497E).

Typography: Elegant Lora (Serif) for high-impact titles, paired with the modern Inter (Sans-Serif) for body text, maximizing readability and polish.

Whitespace: Maximal use of negative space to ensure every element on the slide is intentional and high-value.
